# ChatApp

# Desciption

A social media and coding forum app to share life updates or get coding help. This app is perfect for classmates to come together 
and share about themselves or get help on homework.

We envision this app to be a fun and easy way to give life updates and share experences that you have had. We all worked hard to make sure that the application fit the style we wanted
and was easy to navigate. All you have to do is register at the main menu. Then you will be sent back to the main menu where you can login. Once you click the login button you will be sent to your dashboard where you can start making posts. After you have decided you have made enough post you can logout to the main menu with the logout button. Simple and easy to use!
